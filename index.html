I am interested in Finance and Tech, especially in areas which lie in the intersection of maths and software.

I'm an amateur engineering enthusiast, and my interests primarily lie in motorsports; friction, aerodynamics, powertrain, electronics.

For a long time, I have wanted a place to share my thoughts and experiments online. I will try and grow this page into something more useful in the next few years.  

I hope that by having read this stylish page, your day has improved at least a little bit.
